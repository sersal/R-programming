The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals and are in the tidy dataset "data" are:
  mean(): Mean value
  std(): Standard deviation
  meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency.
The activity type and the subject are the last two columns in the set.

The variables in the "data.means" dity data set is arranged according to the subject and activity and for each case the mean of the values in "data" is stored.

The way raw data is processed is explained below.
  1. The raw data files containing the subjects for training and testing cases are loaded. Besides, the raw data set with the feature labels is also loaded.
  2. The raw data sets for inputs are loaded using the information from features labels set is used to name the columns.
  3. The raw data sets for ouputs are loaded.
  4. The train data set is formed by binding by columns train input, subjects and train output sets.
  5. The same for testing sets.
  6. Both resulting sets are binded by rows.
  7. The raw data containing the labels for activities is loaded.
  8. In the set resulting from 6, the activity labels are renamed according to information from 7.
  9. Columns corresponding to means and standard deviations are located.
  10. The data set obtained in 8 is subsetting accordingly.
  11. A second tidy data set is obtained by aggregating set in 10 by subject and activity using the mean as aggregation function.
  12. The resulting set is saved.
